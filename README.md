# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the project
Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Analysis and Results
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables.

* Add Tectonic Plate Data
Using the knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

* Add Major Earthquake Data
Using the knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, we’ll add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). We'll also add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

* Add an Additional Map
Using the knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js we add a third map style to your earthquake map.
